# BTread

I purchased a mini treadmill for underneath my standing desk, and the app its manual suggested (FitShow) wouldn't make it past the login screen, so I decided to make my own to track usage.

## Usage

**EXCLUSIVELY FOR WINDOWS AT THE MOMENT**

Download/Clone the repo and run `.\make.ps1` to automatically build the `dist\` folder. `BTread.exe` can be run directly out of this folder.
